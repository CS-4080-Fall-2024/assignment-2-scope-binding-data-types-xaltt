Question 1: 
Statement
    |
Assignment
    |
Identifier "=" Expression
A                   |
                    Term
                    |
        Term "*" Factor
          B         |   
                (Expression)
                    |
                    Term
                Term "*" Factor
                C (Expression)
                    |
                Expression "+" Term
                    A       B
Leftmost derivation:
1. Statement -> Assignment
2. Assignment -> A = Expression
3. Expression -> Term
4. Term -> Term * Factor -> B * Factor
5. Factor -> (Expression)
6. Expression -> Term
7. Term -> Term * Factor -> C * (Expression)
8. Expression -> Expression + Term -> A + B
Which gives A = B * (C * (A+B))


Question 2:
a. 128
b. 126
c. 101
